			Alexander is a software engineer (BSc) with <span wicket:id="yearsworking"></span> years of experience in creating system solutions for national and 
			international film distribution companies at a company called <a href="http://www.maccs.com"><b>MACCS International</b></a>. This includes, but is not
			limited to solutions for sales, finance, and logistics.<br><br>
			In the first period of his career, he started as a software developer working on both maintenance and new enhancements to the enterprise application,
			and quickly grew to taking lead in projects, setup Maccs at new clients both in the Netherlands and abroad (mainly in Europe), and training the end users.
			<br><br>
			During the second period, he became team lead for a group of developers to maintain and evolve the Maccs application, which quickly evolved into a management role. 
			Because of the nature of this role, having to deal more with politics than actual programming, he felt he was losing touch with his original passion developing software.  
			He decided to go back to University at the age of 38 to gain new knowledge and insights in the field of software engineering.<br>
			<br>
			Today, he is working on Java projects that are mainly based on service-oriented-architecture solutions.   
			
			</p>
			In his professional life he has worked with:
			<ul>
			  <li>Java (Eclipse/IntelliJ)</li>
			  <li>PowerScript: PowerBuilder</li>
			  <li>Hibernate / JPA</li>
			  <li>Wicket</li>
			  <li>AWS</li>
			  <li>MariaDB</li>
			  <li>Oracle</li>
			  <li>Windows</li>
			  <li>Linux</li>
			</ul>
			and at home with:
			<ul>
			  <li>Java (EE) (Eclipse)</li>
			  <li>JavaScript</li>
			  <li>Java Android (Eclipse/Android Studio)</li>
			  <li>MySQL</li>
			  <li>Hibernate</li>
			  <li>Wicket</li>
			  <li>Bootstrap</li>
			  <li>Spring (mainly the webservices part of the framework)</li>
			  <li>Maven</li>
			  <li>Tomcat</li>
			  <li>Linux</li>
			</ul>
			and is currently experimenting with:
			<ul>
			  <li>Python (Pycharm)</li>
			  <li>TensorFlow</li>
			  <li>Theano</li>
			</ul>
			During his current study at the <a href="http://www.phdportal.eu/universities/454/open-university-of-the-netherlands.html">Open University</a> in the Netherlands, 
			he got to learn more about:
			<ul>
			  <li><a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, a functional language.</li>
			  <li><a href="http://www.rascal-mpl.org/">Rascal</a>, a functional language based on Java specialized on software metrics.</li>
			  <li>Deep Neural Networks, mainly focused on Internet security</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="text-justify">
			In 2018, he started working on his master thesis, trying to prune a large-scale deep (feed-forward) neural network that is able to detect malicious botnet
			activities, in order to extract rules to learn what the network actually learned to differentiate normal traffic from malicious traffic.

	    	Given the type of content on this site, it will be no surprise to you that Alex is passionate about (retro) games. But he also
	    	enjoys cruising around on his motorcycle, and spending time with friends (especially on sunny days).
