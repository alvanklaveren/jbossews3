			Alexander is a software engineer (BSc) with <span wicket:id="yearsworking"></span> years of experience in creating system solutions for national and 
			international film distribution companies at a company called <a href="http://www.maccs.com"><b>MACCS International</b></a>. This includes, but is not
			limited to, solutions for sales, finance, and logistics.<br><br>
			In the first period of his career, he started as a software developer working both maintenance and on new enhancements to the enterprise application,
			and quickly moved to taking lead in projects, deploying Maccs on-site at clients both in the Netherlands and abroad (mainly in Europe), and training the end users.
			<br><br>
			During the second period, he became team lead for a group of developers to maintain and evolve the Maccs application, which quickly evolved into a management role. 
			Because of the nature of this role, dealing more with meetings than actual hands-on software development, he felt he was losing touch with his original passion.  
			He decided to go back to University at the age of 38 to gain new knowledge and insights in the field of software engineering.<br>
			<br>
			Today, he is working with Java to create cloud-based solutions.   
			
			</p>
			In his professional life he has worked with:
			<ul>
			  <li>Java (Eclipse/IntelliJ)</li>
			  <li>PowerScript: PowerBuilder</li>
			  <li>Hibernate/JPA</li>
			  <li>Spring (Boot/MVC/AOP)/Wicket</li>
			  <li>CSS/Bootstrap</li>

			In 2018, he started working on his master thesis, pruning, and extracting rules from, a large-scale deep (feed-forward) neural network capable of 
			detecting malicious botnet activities, in order to understand what the network actually learned to tell what is normal traffic and what is malicious traffic.

	    	Given the type of content on this site, it will be no surprise to you that Alex is passionate about (retro) games. But he also
	    	enjoys cruising around on his motorcycle, and spending time with friends (especially on sunny days).
