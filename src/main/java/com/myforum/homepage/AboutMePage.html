		    <p class="text-justify">
			Alexander is a software engineer (MSc) with <span wicket:id="yearsworking"></span> years of experience in creating system solutions for national and 
			international film distribution companies at a company called <a href="http://www.maccs.com"><b>MACCS International</b></a>, a <a href="https://vistagroup.co.nz/">Vista Group</a> Company. 
			This includes, but is not limited to, solutions for theatrical sales, finance, interfaces, and logistics.<br><br>
			In the first period of his career, he started as a software developer working both on maintenance and new enhancements to the enterprise application called Maccs,
			and quickly moved to taking lead in projects, deploying Maccs on-site at clients both in the Netherlands and abroad (mainly in Europe), and training the end users.
			<br><br>
			During the second period, he became team lead for a group of developers to maintain and evolve the Maccs application, which quickly evolved into a management role. 
			Because of the nature of this role, dealing more with meetings than actual hands-on software development, he felt he was losing touch with his original passion.  
			He decided to go back to University at the age of 38 to gain new knowledge and insights in the field of software engineering, ending his study with
			a thesis on rule extraction from a large deep neural network.<br>
			<br>
			Currently he is working on new cloud-based solutions, microservices, and websites to support exhibitors and distributors, mainly developed using
			Java and Typescript.   
			
			</p>
			In his professional life he has worked with:
			<ul>
			  <li>Java (Eclipse/IntelliJ)</li>
			  <li>PowerScript: PowerBuilder</li>
			  <li>Hibernate/JPA</li>
			  <li>Spring (Boot/MVC/AOP)/Wicket</li>

	    	Given the type of content on this site, it will be no surprise to you that Alex is passionate about (retro) games. But he also
	    	enjoys cruising around on his motorcycle, and spending time with friends (especially on sunny days).
