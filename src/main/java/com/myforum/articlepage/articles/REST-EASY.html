           <h2 class="blog-post-title">What is Rest-Easy</h2>
           <p class="blog-post-meta">July 24, 2016 by <a href="#">Alex</a></p>

           <p style="text-align:justify">JBoss Rest-Easy is a framework for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">Java Rest Services</a> that enables you to focus on the services themselves instead of being distracted by getting these services up and running.</p>
       <hr>
       <p style="text-align:justify">The above sounds very attractive, but in the real world it never is quite that simple. Although frameworks are awesome and save you a lot of time figuring out things you will immediately
		   forget once you have implemented them, the framework contains assumptions in the form of imported libraries. So although the framework itself would work perfectly fine when you are using that framework
			and that framework alone, when you want to use more than one framework (in this particular case Hibernate), there can be overlap between the two frameworks when it comes to imported libraries.</p>
		<br>
		        <h3 class="h3">Compatiblity issue</h3>
		<p style="text-align:justify">So far, the most common issue encountered with Rest-Easy and Hibernate is the overlap of the Jassist library. Of course, depending on the versions you use, the combination may be different,
		   but in this particular case, older versions of Rest-Easy (anything below 3.0.8 if I am not mistaken) result in a jassist error in Hibernate (5.0.1). Newer versions of Rest-Easy (like the recommended 3.0.18) work
		   fine. So doing a little research on the Internet looking for compatibility between framework versions should solve the issue quickly.... <br>If only it was that simple.</p>
		<br>
		        <h3 class="h3">What changed in the framework ?</h3>
		<p style="text-align:justify"> An open-source framework is, like many JAVA frameworks are, rapidly changed to prevent phase-out in an environment at the edge of chaos. The community may decide to remove 
		  support for one way of configuration and implement or enhance another, depending on what changes in Tomcat, JBoss, GlassFish, Java EE, and so on and so forth. In my particular case, I 
		  received a warning message in the startup log that the easy auto-scan was no longer supported and should use a 3.0 servlet container. Well, that made it a bit more complicated as I previously
		  downgraded to an older version of Rest-Easy, in which all services worked, but made Hibernate fail. And now, with the newer version of Rest-Easy installed, Hibernate was working again, but none of my services were available. </p>
		       <blockquote>
		         <p style="text-align:justify"><big>an open-source framework is ... rapidly changed</big></p>
		        </blockquote>
		<p style="text-align:justify"> So I had to create a class containing a (servlet)application extending the javax.ws.core. This should have been enough, if not that Tomcat does not automatically scan all the services. So I had
		   to register these services in this application-class. </p>
		<br>
		        <h3 class="h3">Before adding a framework...</h3>
		<p style="text-align:justify">This entire exercise took me about <strong>4 hours</strong> and my advise to you is to first add the jars of a particular framework to your pom, build, and install, your webapplication,
				   launch it, and check if all pages work. If it does, you can continue to find more information on the framework of that version. The other way around can get you where I was
			a couple of hours ago, where the auto-scan of services peeked my interest, only to find out that the version you where meant to use does no longer support that functionality.</p>
		<br>
		        <h2>The implementation</h2>
		        <h3 class="h3">Java classes</h3>
		<p style="text-align:justify">The following is a minimalistic subset of the actual code in my services, but gives you an idea of how Rest-Easy can be used, based on the autoscan not being available,
						   and subscribing the services in the application class. Let's start with the service class, HelloPojo.java, that we are going to use later on.</p>
		<big>HelloPojo.java</big>
		<pre><code>import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.PathParam;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

@Path("/message")
public class HelloPojo &#123;

	@GET
	@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
	@Path("/&#123;param&#125;")
	public Response sendMessage(@PathParam("param") String name) {
		String result = "Hello " + name;
		if(name.isEmpty()) &#123;
			result = "Hello galaxy!";
		&#125;
        	return Response.status(200).entity(result).build();
  	&#125;
&#125;</code></pre>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
			<ul class="blog-ul" style="text-align:justify">
			<li>
			The service class starts with a couple of imports that cover the rest web services. In this particular case, only the http GET-request is imported, but you could just
			as easily declare PUT, POST and DELETE. 
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
			javax.ws.rs.<i>Produces</i> is a nice way of telling the system how you would like the result to be returned from the service. In this case we choose (javax.ws.rs.core.)<i>MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN</i>, 
			because the service only returns text, and it also prevents injection of unwanted markup codes, e.g. HTML, PHP or JavaScript.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
			javax.ws.rs.<i>Path</i> and .<i>PathParam</i> tells the system what the URL request should look like and what part of it to accept as a parameter, rather than a fixed location. In this case the service can be
			started by adding /message/{param} to the url in your browser. The {param} argument is translated in the functions prototype assigning <i>param</i> to a String called <i>name</i>.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
			javax.ws.rs.core.Response is the opposite of a HTTP request, where the service "responds" to a request. This is how a service talks back to the receiving party.
			Interesting to see is that you can prepare the response with a given status (in this case 200, which means we tell the receiving party that the request was succesful.)
			You can easily find more info on all HTML error codes you can use to communicate.
			</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
		 The function name <i>sendMessage</i> is a randomly picked function name. Because the servlet application is responsible for assigning services, you do not have to declare this particular function name anywhere.
		 Of course, it might be helpful to declare a plausible function name to use in your unit tests.
		 <br>
		 To make sure this service is recognized by the framework, we implement a Servlet Application class called <i>RestServices.java</i>.
		 </p>
		
		<big>RestServices.java</big>
<pre><code>import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

import javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;

@ApplicationPath("/services")
public class RestServices extends Application &#123;
    private Set&lt;Object&gt; singletons = new HashSet&lt;Object&gt;();

    public RestServices() &#123;
        singletons.add(new HelloPojo());
    &#125;

    @Override
    public Set&lt;Object&gt; getSingletons() &#123;
        return singletons;
    &#125;
&#125;</code></pre>
		
		<p style="text-align:justify">
			<ul class="blog-ul" style="text-align:justify">
			<li>
			The import contains <i>ApplicationPath</i> and <i>Application</i>. <i>Application</i> refers to the servlet application parent class in the framework. How we tell the system about
			this class is done further down this article in a file called <i>web.xml</i>.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
			Next the <i>ApplicationPath</i> is used to declare the URL part to identify the Servlet Application. In this case it is /services, which leads to /services/message/{param} to get 
			to the Hello service we created in <i>HelloPojo</i>. The fun part is that you can declare as many Servlet Application containers as you want, if you want different URL references to 
			a separate set of services, for instance /loginservices and /forumservices.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
			The only thing left to do is to subscribe this service to this particular container, which we do by adding an instance of the <i>HelloPojo</i> service class to a <i>Set</i> called <i>singletons</i> 
			(name is randomly picked). Mind the override on function <i>getSingletons()</i>, which overrides the parent class' function to get to the Set of subscribed services (pojos and/or beans).
			</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<h3 class="h3">Configuration</h3>
			<p style="text-align:justify">
			Now for some configuration. Fortunately, this is limited to only two files, <i>pom.xml</i> (for building and deploying your web application) and <i>web.xml</i>.
		</p>
		<big>pom.xml</big>
<pre><code>...

...</code></pre>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
			The above configuration contains (some of or at least the minimum of) the dependencies needed in the Hello service example. To make live easier, I would advise you to add a property, which in this case is
			<i>resteasy.version</i> , to control the version number of the dependencies.

			The first part is commented out, as we are not going to use this functionality. In previous versions, this makes it really <i>easy</i> to register your 
			services, because it is done for you by the framework. It is not hard to imagine that when you are running more than one servlet application, you would 
			like to configure this yourself, so it actually makes sense they dropped support for this.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
			The servlet-mapping prefix has to be equal to the ApplicationPath in (one of) the servlet application class you declared, for the framework to find it.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
			The ResteasyBootstrap listener is responsible for initializing some basic components of Rest-Easy.
			Next, we let the webserver know who is responsible for dispatching the servlet(s), which in this case is Rest-Easy.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
			Now all that's left to do, is map the servlet to a URL, which in our example is "/services/*". Mind the wildcard, which tells the webserver that
			anything directly following "/services/" should be handled by our servlet, and not, for instance, by the browser.
			</li>
			</ul>
