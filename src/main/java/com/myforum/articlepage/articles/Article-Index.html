			  <p style="text-align:justify"> The below articles are short stories about my own first experience with new
					frameworks, languages, methodologies, and so on and so forth. The main reason for writing these stories is
					to be able to fall back on what I have done before. When using new things, there is always a couple of things
					that you only have to do once. And because of it, easily forget. Then when the time comes to do it all over 
					again (because maybe you messed up your environment), it will again take you the many hours you spent on making 
					it work the first time.<br><br>
					Because I am not the only one having these problems, I am sharing my experiences and knowledge with all of you.
					Have fun reading them.
