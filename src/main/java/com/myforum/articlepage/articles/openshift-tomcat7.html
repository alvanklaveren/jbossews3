            <p style="text-align:justify">Frustrating as it can be for developers, a lot of providers, that offer solutions for hosting your website, do not deliver the hosting for free.
					  Except for OpenShift, which not so much delivers you an entirely free solution, but at least gives you enough space and CPU to test, develop
					  and try out OpenShift before committing to pay for additional services. With a system they call cartridges, they offer fully pre-installed webservers
					  to work with. So although it does not offer you full access to the webserver application itself (e.g. Tomcat or JBoss), it does
					  save you the trouble of setting it up and managing it properly.<p>

<h3 id="h3">Before we start...</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Prior to reading the article I expect you to have at least some knowledge of and experience with:
<ol class="blog-ul" style="text-align:justify">
<li>the JAVA programming language</li>
<li>relational databases, preferrably MySQL</li>
<li>the Linux filesystem</li>
<li>source version(ing) control software, preferrably GIT</li>
<li>Maven .pom files (this is key to working with OpenShift !)</li>
<li>Eclipse IDE (including EGit-plugin and Maven-plugin)</li>
<li>RSA/SSH keys</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify">Before I start explaining the how-to, mind that this article's focus is on running a Java (EE) 
webapplication on a Tomcat 7 server, with the java webapplication being developed in the Eclipse IDE. 
Adding other languages (like Python) and webservers (like JBoss) will differ, sometimes slightly, and sometimes completely. 
<br><br>
<h3 id="h3">Setup of Webserver on OpenShift</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">
First create an account on OpenShift (no explanation necessary). Next, Login to Openshift, go to the <i><big>Applications</big></i> 
tabpage and click <i><big>Add Application...</big></i>. 
<br>
<img src="/images/openshift-tomcat7-1.png" alt="<picture not found>" width="50%" height=30%" style="border:1px solid black"></img>
<br><br>
It is important to understand that you can not “add” your entire, already existing, webapplication into Openshift with this button, rather you 
create a new webapplication on the pre-installed cartridge, which you will later modify. 
<br><br>
In the next window, there is quite a selection of webservers for different languages like Java, Python and PHP. In this particular case we look for, 
and select, <i><big>Tomcat 7 (JBoss EWS 2.0)</big></i>.
<br>
<img src="/images/openshift-tomcat7-2.png" alt="<picture not found>" width="80%" height=40%" style="border:1px solid black"></img>
<br><br>
In the next window, select the name for the public URL you are going to use. This will be the URL used to gain access to your webapplication. 
Because we are using a free (testing) environment, you do not need an explanation of the remaining setup on this page, and go immediately down 
to the button at the bottom named <i><big>Create Application</big></i>.  Mind that this can take a while.
<br>
<img src="/images/openshift-tomcat7-3.png" alt="<picture not found>" width="50%" height=5%" style="border:1px solid black"></img>
<br><br>
Congratulations! You just created your first webserver cartridge. But we are not there yet. Now that we have a pre-installed webserver, we need to gain access to it through GIT.
The page you are on now, gives you all the details you need to get the source code from the repository, so make sure you write down or copy the info from this page.
If you did not, then find the URI on the application's tabpage (also shown two pictures down this document), and instruction on the application's webpage.
<br><br>
Next click on the <i><big>Settings</big></i> tabpage and add your RSA key by clicking the <i><big>Add a new key...</big></i>.
If you do not know how to add or even create your own personal RSA key, continue reading the article and come back later to add the key you just generated.
<br><br>
</p>
<h3 id="h3">Import project from Git</h3>
<h4 id="h3">When not using Eclipse</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">Expecting you already installed GIT, you now have to open a command-line terminal. Once there, go to the folder you have your GIT repository installed (usually called .git) and
run the commands you just copied:
<br>
<pre><code>git clone ssh://{uniqueId}@yoururl-domain.rhcloud.com/~/git/{yoururl}>.git/</code></pre>
<br>
This should now copy the source-code for the webapp into your repository.
<br><br>
<h4 id="h3">When using Eclipse</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">First setup your network connections in Eclipse. 
<br>
Go to <i><big>Window → Preferences → General → Network Connections → SSH2</big></i>. 
<br>
If you did not yet create an RSA key, then do it now by going to the Key Management tabpage:
<br>
<img src="/images/openshift-tomcat7-4.png" alt="<picture not found>" width="100%" height=50%" style="border:1px solid black"></img>
<br><br>
Be sure to remember the passphrase for your generated RSA key to be able to use your private key.
When you created a key, go back to the browser and add this key to your OpenShift account.
<br><br>
Open Eclipse, go to <i><big>File → Import</big></i> and select <i><big>Git → Projects from Git</big></i>. Press <i><big>Next</big></i>.
<br>
In the next window, choose <i><big>Clone URI</big></i> and press <i><big>Next</big></i>. 
<br> 
Now we have to locate the source repository. Remember you wrote down the specific details in. You can also copy it from the 
application's page itself.
<br>
<img src="/images/openshift-tomcat7-5.png" alt="<picture not found>" width="100%" height=30%" style="border:1px solid black"></img>
<br><br>
Next, paste it in the URI input field and the rest of the fields should be automatically populated.
<br>
<img src="/images/openshift-tomcat7-6.png" alt="<picture not found>" width="80%" height=60%" style="border:1px solid black"></img>
<br><br>
The password is equal to the password you use to login to OpenShift. Press <i></big>Next</big></i> and you will be asked to apply the
passphrase for your rsa-key. It can so happen that the key-certificate has not been accepted yet in the SSH2 settings in Eclipse. 
In that case, you will get a warning that the certificate has not yet been accepted for this particular site. Choose “yes” to accept 
it, adding the OpenShift URI to the known hosts.
<br><br>
And now for something not so pleasant. It often happens that it will now give an <i><big>invalid packet line header</big></i> error. 
You can find this message in your “Error Log” tabpage. This is probably a Git plugin issue, as it happens in both Eclipse and Netbeans. 
The most common warning popup you will get is
<br>
<img src="/images/openshift-tomcat7-7.png" alt="<picture not found>" width="100%" height=30%" style="border:1px solid black"></img>
<br><br>
This is a known issue that has not been fixed for years. The only advise I have is, remove your URI from the known hosts in SSH2 setup, next 
close Eclipse, open Eclipse again, import project from Git (again), copy the URI info from the website (again) and paste it in the URI field. 
<br><br>
For some reason, it is essential to not select it from the dropdownlist the URI field offers you, containing the ssh URI you used previously. 
Maybe it defaults more than you can see in this setup window and will fail with the same error we saw earlier. 
So make sure to again type it in (or paste it) in the URI field.
<br><br>
Fingers crossed and with any luck (always remember that <i>luck</i> is another word for <i>perseverance</i>), 
you will now import the project into your Eclipse workspace.
<br><br>
Let us go and see what this “default” project looks like.
<br>
<img src="/images/openshift-tomcat7-8.png" alt="<picture not found>" width="25%" height=50%" style="border:1px solid black"></img>
<br><br>
As you can see, it is a nice template for starting your webapp. I recommend testing the repository immediately by pushing some changes 
to OpenShift. Try modifying the index.html and push it back to OpenShift. When it is done uploading and building, go to the URL of your 
application and check to see if the changes have been applied correctly.
<br><br>
Now that it works, you can start copying your already existing application to this project or start making a new one. 
For obvious reasons, I am not going to explain how to create a webapplication in this tutorial. 
<br><br>
I recommend you make sure, that your own testing-environment uses the same webserver and Java version, have the pom.xml contain all the 
dependencies in your project and run Maven build/install using the pom.xml and test it by running the Tomcat7 server, rather than using 
the “run as..” option on the project. If the project compiles and runs using pom.xml, you can be sure it will do the same when pushing 
the project to OpenShift.
<br><br>
One thing I will address is the OpenShift values in the pom.xml file.
<br>
<big>pom.xml</big>
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;profiles&gt;
&lt;profile&gt;
    &lt;!-- When built in OpenShift the 'openshift' profile will be used when 
    invoking mvn. Use this profile for any OpenShift specific customization
    your app will need. By default that is to put the resulting archive into
    the 'webapps' folder. --&gt;
    &lt;!-- http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-building-for-different-
    environments.html --&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;openshift&lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;build&gt;
	&lt;finalName&gt;test&lt;/finalName&gt;
	&lt;plugins&gt;
	  &lt;plugin&gt;
	    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-war-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	    &lt;version&gt;2.1.1&lt;/version&gt;
	    &lt;configuration&gt;
	      &lt;outputDirectory&gt;webapps&lt;/outputDirectory&gt;
		&lt;warName&gt;ROOT&lt;/warName&gt;
	    &lt;/configuration&gt;
	  &lt;/plugin&gt;
 	&lt;/plugins&gt;
    &lt;/build&gt;
  &lt;/profile&gt;
&lt;/profiles&gt;
</code></pre>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Make sure you stick to this configuration to prevent OpenShift from failing to compile the pom.xml. 
<br><br>
If the push ends succesfully, but you still seem to have a problem with OpenShift, then login to the remote from commandline using 
<i><big>ssh</big></i> or <i><big>rhc</big></i>. Both are commandline shells to remote systems. You can find the command you need on 
the application's tabpage.
<br>
<img src="/images/openshift-tomcat7-9.png" alt="<picture not found>" width="100%" height=50%" style="border:1px solid black"></img>
<br><br>
In this terminal, you can check configuration and log files, diskspace and the git repository. Most of the folders you see in the 
root are aliases of folders in (if I am not mistaken) <i><big>app-root</big></i>.
<br>
<img src="/images/openshift-tomcat7-10.png" alt="<picture not found>" width="90%" height=50%" style="border:1px solid black"></img>
<br><br>
In this early stage of learning how to use OpenShift, (for now) the most important folder is the one where the log file is stored. 
Do not get confused by the name <i><big>jbossews.log</big></i>. This is a RedHat thing (Remember when you installed the Tomcat cartridge 
it was called “Tomcat 7 (JBOSS EWS 2.0)”). You can use <i><big>vi jbossews.log</big></i> to see the output from your (running) Tomcat7 webserver.
</p>
<br>
<h4 id="h3">Additional cartridges</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Suppose you want to install additional services in this one cartridge (for instance, a database), you can do so by following the instructions 
on the application's tabpage in OpenShift. It is up to you to decide what to install and what not. Most of these cartridges are very easy to 
install so I will not bother writing a tutorial for them. 
</p>
<br>
<h3 id="h3">Final words</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">
In this document I described how to get started with OpenShift for your Java / Tomcat7 webapplication. Mind that this is the bare minimum of 
things to do, but they are by far the most essential.

Currently there are many tutorials on YouTube where someone explains how to upload a pre-compiled WAR to OpenShift. Do not be tempted to do so, 
because they tell you how to push a WAR to the repository of OpenShift. If you do this, you will run out of diskspace fairly quick when pushing 
the WAR to the repository over and over again. And getting more space means paying for it.  
<br><br><br>
<small>The following tools and frameworks were used in this example: 
<br>Eclipse Mars, Tomcat 7.0, Java EE 7, OpenShift Tomcat7 cartridge
